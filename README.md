# Zig-Showdown
A community effort to create a small multiplayer 3D shooter game in pure zig

## Development

### Communication

The main communication happens via the [Zig Showtime](https://zig.show/) discord.

### Contribution

### Checkout

Clone the repo and all submodules:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zig-community/Zig-Showdown --recursive
```

### Committing

Feel free to create a PR to this repo, but please make sure you've run `zig fmt` on your files to keep a consistent state.

### Build

```sh
# Use this to build the project
zig build

# Use this to run the game in a debug session
zig build run
```

Recommended to be built with the latest master, but Zig 0.7.0 should be fine.
